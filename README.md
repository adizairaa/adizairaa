### Hello! I'm AdilaðŸ‘‹
 I have a diverse academic and professional background. I hold a degree in Tourism Management and am currently in the 5th semester of my Systems Analysis and Development program. My current role in the hospitality industry has honed my organizational and analytical skills, and it has also inspired me to explore the exciting world of technology.

I am passionate about data analysis, problem-solving, and creating innovative solutions. As I work towards transitioning into a tech-driven career, Iâ€™m actively learning and contributing to projects that showcase my skills in programming, data analysis, and system development.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and letâ€™s connect to collaborate on impactful projects! ðŸ‘‹
